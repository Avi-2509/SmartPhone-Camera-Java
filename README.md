# Smartphone photoplethysmography (SPPG)
## What is [PPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram)?
###### Plethysmography is the science of measuring volume changes in different parts of the body.

- A photoplethysmograph uses light to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. 
- This noninvasive technology can be utilized to measure heart rate, and a number of other physiological parameters. 
- Traditionally the measurement is carried out with a pulse oximeter
- A pulse oximeter is a small wearable device (clipped to a for example a finger) which collects and analyzes the reflected or transmitted waves after casting ight on the bodypart.

## Heart rate (HR) monitoring with a smartphone?

Smartphones have just the tools a professional PPG has: a ligt source (the flash) and a photosensor (the camera). 
They have the potential to determine HR in real time, after covering the camera and the flash with a fingertip at the same time. 
This way the light reflected from the finger is collected by the camera. HR is calculated after the necessary signal processing.
